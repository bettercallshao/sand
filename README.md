Try simulations easily.

## Why does this exist?

In college, I enjoyed playing with dynamic solvers, including LT-SPICE, Ansys, SolidWorks, but most of all MATLAB / Simulink. One day, I was trying to explain to my wife (a financier) how to use [_Gain Margin_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bode_plot#Gain_margin_and_phase_margin) to gauge the stability of a system, ending up having to explain what is a linear system and a state space. It came off as very vague and mystical, but I rather believe a second order linear system is the simplest system to study properly and rationalize about, and one can gain a great deal of confidence in the natural world by understanding a linear system. But most people don't learn it in school, and instead rely on conventional wisdoms of various kinds to dictate their everyday decision making. Therefore, I am trying preach the useful concepts arising from studying linear systems, and **sand** is created as an accessible tool capable of simple simulations that helps with the preaching. For serious scientific research, I believe Simulink is great, and Xcos is a great alternative.

## How do I use this?

Use the app by making an **Diagram**, setting **Initializations**, then observing **Graphs**, and finally **Sharing** it with your friends.

### Diagram

Top left quadrant is a **System** diagram composed from different **Types** of **Boxes** (aka transfer functions) of unique **Ids**. Each box has many **Ports**, representing **Variables**, with inputs on the left and outputs on the right. **Linked** ports share the same Variable. A system can be simulated given initial values.

- An initial 2nd order with step input is generated by default.
- Boxes can be crated by selecting a type and an unique id.
- Boxes can be removed by clicking the X in the box.
- An input port can be linked to an output port by dragging.
- Links can be broken by double clicking.
- Box types are predefined in [builtinBoxType.js](https://github.com/bettercallshao/sand/blob/main/src/sandio/builtinBoxType.js).

### Initialization

Top right quadrant is **Initialization** assigning each **Variable** an initial value. A variable is named after the output end, unless it represents only an input, in which case the name starts with a ":". **stepCount** and **stepSize** are special configs for the solver.

### Graph

Bottom quadrants are scatter plot **Graphs** of variables against each other. **length** is a special variable representing time. Whenever the diagram or initialization is changed, the system simulation is rerun, and results are updated on graphs.

### Sharing

The app is always saved in the URL itself. The URL alone captures all of the states, and can be bookmarked or shared. Since the URL is long, for a better sharing experience, consider shortening it with [tinyurl](https://tinyurl.com/app). E.g.

- 2nd order with step input: https://tinyurl.com/h4t3r7a7

## What next?

- More box types, e.g. Dirac, division, square, triangle, etc.
- When states are long, URL may explode. Probably need another way to share.
- The diagram library is kinda ugly, especially the links don't bend gracefully and get hidden behind the boxes.
- Link creation is not validated, connecting two inputs or two outputs doesn't make sense and will make the system invalid.
- Convergence of state is not detected and the solver always runs certain number of steps.
- Whether a box is "constant" type or "persistent" type is not conveyed to the user. This is a key point in understanding the system and how the solver works.
- Whether a variable is "constant" or "persistent" is similarly also not conveyed. Initialization an output of a constant box is pointless because it is overwritten every step. Maybe hide these from the initialization form.
- Maybe rename "length" to "time". "Length" is used because the base could be something else, e.g. the length of a beam.
